# OnlineFoodDeliverySystem
The Online Food Delivery System is a Java-based web/console application developed using Hibernate ORM, MySQL, and Maven. It demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on restaurant menus, showcasing how to integrate Hibernate with a relational database for seamless data management. 

Project Overview: 
The application manages restaurants and their menu items. It allows administrators or users to:

MySQL 8

Maven (for dependency management)

JDBC Driver for MySQL
